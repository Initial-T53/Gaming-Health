# Gaming-Health
Data analysis dashboard of Gaming &amp; Mental Health 

# Project Overview:
A research division within a large health and behavior analytics organization tasked our team with examining how gaming habits influence overall well-being. To address this, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights how gaming duration affects sleep and how reduced sleep, in turn, relates to downstream outcomes such as academic performance and lifestyle indicators.

# Datatset used
[Gaming & Mental Health](https://github.com/Initial-T53/Gaming-Health/blob/main/Gaming%20and%20Mental%20Health.csv)

# Questions(KPI)
* What is the average gaming hours.
* What is the average sleep hours.
* Is there a correlation between gaming and sleep hours?
* How does the data change when you look at different age groups?
* What are the moods based on the amount of sleep hours?
* Does sleep have a correlation with social isolation?
* Does sleep correlate with weight change?
* Does sleep affect a students GPA?

# Final Conclusion:
The analysis shows a clear pattern: as gaming hours increase, sleep decreases, and reduced sleep is linked to several negative quality-of-life indicators. Participants with sufficient sleep consistenly show better outcomes, including healthier weight trends, lower social isolation, and improved moods.
